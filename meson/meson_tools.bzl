"""Module extension fetching hermetic meson + ninja.

meson is pure Python (no third-party deps). We expose its source as a
`py_library` so consumers can `import mesonbuild.mesonmain` directly —
this avoids nested py_binary subprocesses, which fight Bazel's
runfiles-discovery semantics.

ninja is a prebuilt single-binary zip from the upstream GitHub release.
We extract and expose it as a label; the meson_configure rule puts its
directory on PATH for meson's subprocess to find it.

We deliberately do NOT use rules_foreign_cc's meson + ninja toolchains.
Those are designed to be driven by rules_foreign_cc's own build-script
framework (which sets EXT_BUILD_ROOT and orchestrates runfiles). Using
them outside that framework hits walls; this fetch-and-go pattern is
simpler and a better fit for "just run meson setup, capture the
compdb."
